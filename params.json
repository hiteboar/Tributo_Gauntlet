{"name":"Gauntlet Tribute","tagline":"Little tribute to the game \"Gauntlet 2\"","body":"I recently developed a tribute of the game Gauntlet in C++. \r\n\r\nThis is a tile based game, and in concequence all the images used in it are tiles with 16x16 pixels. Even so the game movement is independent from the tiles, this fact, afford for an accurate movement from the player and the enemies. This, cause that the collision  between objects can't be calculate with using tiles, in order to solve that problem, I created a collider object for every object in the scene that can collide with another diferent object and I calculate the intesection in every object in order to detect if the object are colliding or not. \r\n\r\nIn order to develop all this tribute game, I use a modular programming technique. You can see the code and test the game in [GitHub] (https://github.com/hiteboar/Tributo_Gauntlet) and a video demostation from [Youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8bARr7XllY&feature=youtu.be).\r\n\r\n![Example Image](http://i.imgur.com/2PCCQhW.png)\r\n\r\nMy LinkedIn: [Francisco Bosch] (https://es.linkedin.com/in/francisco-bosch-1a1bba109)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
